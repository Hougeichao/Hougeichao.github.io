Hi! I'm Yingchao (Chris), a Ph.D. student in [Professor Paul Plucinsky's group](https://sites.usc.edu/plucinsky/) at the University of Southern California. My research focuses on mechanical metamaterials, solid mechanics, kirigami/origami design, and topology optimization. In short, I think about how to cut, fold, and optimize materials to make them behave in ways Mother Nature never intended. 

We aim to build rigorous theoretical frameworks to understand and predict the fascinating behaviors that emerge in mechanical metamaterials, from floppy modes and bistability to programmable shape transformations, to name a few. I'm always excited by how geometry can encode function and motion.

By day, I battle equations to uncover hidden mechanics embedded in metamaterials; by night, I fight the urge to turn every piece of paper into a kirigami prototype—or analyze Real Madrid’s latest formation (¡Hala Madrid).
